# Tetris
C# Forms Tetris  
1-) I mostly used my own methods for this project  
2-) The assets are only for showing the next piece  
3-)Most of the solutions are not performance and memory efficient but this assignment was about not to use built-in methods.  
I am actually not proud of this code... I had to do it in a short period of time  
I will definitely optimise this code someday... See you then.
